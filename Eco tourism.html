     The term eco-tourism refers to eco-friendly nature based tourism for nature lovers with enduring passion to admire and enjoy life at its natural best. Different from Mass tourism and luxury tourism, Ecotourism is promoted to conserve nature for the welfare of living beings. It is not about watching nature and deriving pleasure from it, rather it is feeling nature, caring for it and spreading mass awareness.<br />Situated on the eastern coast of the country, Odisha is rich in minerals. Gifted with a bountiful wealth of nature, certain definite measures have been taken for the benefits of local people.<br />

Bhitarkanika (literally extraordinarily beautiful interior) extends over 800 square km; a tangled web of forest covers half, the other a vast and complex network of estuarine waterways. The park is home to over 215 species of birds including winter migrants from Central Asia and Europe and a diverse range of wildlife, most notably the elusive saltwater crocodile and fragile Olive Ridley turtles. The majestic mangroves are best navigated by boat – be sure to keep your hand out of the waters!  <br/>

In 1967, a wild female tiger approached Nandan Kanan, and scaling a high fence, she crept around until she found the tiger enclosure. She then climbed up a concrete wall, and leapt down into the enclosure, thus perhaps becoming the only wild  animal in existence who has ever opted to join in a zoo.<br/>
   In addition to the white tigers, endangered species such as the Asiatic Lion, three Indian crocodilians, sanghai, lion tailed macaque, Nilgiri langur, Indian pangolin, mouse deer and countless birds, reptiles, and fish have been breeding successfully here. There is also a successful Black Panther breeding programme. In all, over 67 kinds of mammals, 18 varieties of reptiles and 81 species of birds co-exist in the deeply forested boundaries of Nandan Kanan.<br/>
   Nandan Kanan, with its Zoo, the beautiful Botanical Gardens, the lake, nature trails and facilities for amusement, is a definite must for all visitors to Odisha (Formerly Orissa).<br />
